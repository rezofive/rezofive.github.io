                        <h5>RISK ASSESSMENT</h5>
                        <p><b>1. </b> An important aspect of the due diligence process is the assessment of the risks 
                          involved and the acceptability of a prospective Client. Before agreeing to supply a service to a 
                          prospective Client, an assessment of the risks involved should be completed. This involves 
                          assessing the acceptability as a client and the risk associated with the particular services 
                          requested by the Client. This on-going evaluation is necessary to consider relevant issues 
                          before deciding as to whether the required services should be provided.</p>
                        <p><b>2. </b> When entering into the Business relationship with the Client, the ML/TF risk is 
                          assessed on the basis of the documentation and information obtained from a prospective Client. 
                          Special attention must be given to the behavior of and the verbal communication with a 
                          prospective Client as well as the criteria of the High-Risk Clients and Low Risk Clients as 
                          listed in Sections 9 and 10 below. When assessing the ML/TF risk the aim is to set up and 
                          assess the following circumstances - type of the Client, i.e. whether a prospective Client meets 
                          the profile of the typical client of the Company; if not, the additional clarification and/or 
                          documentation must be requested from the Client seeking to establish if there is a high ML/TF 
                          risk. </p>
                        <p><b>3. </b> Special attention is given to the following circumstances which may increase 
                          the ML/TF risk - 1) if the Client is a PEP, 2) where the prospective Client is a non-profit 
                          institution (“NPI”), 3) behavior of a prospective Client reveals that the aims and duration of the 
                          relationship expected by a prospective Client may considerably differ from what is inherent to 
                          the profile of the typical Client of the Company. If so, added clarification and/or documentation 
                          must be requested from the Client looking to establish if there is a high ML/TF risk. Client 
                          must prove if the Client acts as a principal or is represented by the third person (agent);</p>  
                        <p><b>4. </b> Company must assess if the virtual currency exchange and wallet services in 
                          which a prospective Client is interested correspond the nature of the business and the 
                          Transaction profile of such prospective Client; if not, the additional clarification and/or 
                          documentation must be requested from the Client seeking to establish ifthere is a high ML/TF 
                          risk; attention should be drawn where the Client or the potential Client is to transact in new or 
                          developing technologies which may give rise to a threat of ML/TF or the use of Monetary 
                          operations or Transactions that might favor anonymity;
                        </p>
                        <p><b>5. </b> Company must assess where the main place of interests of a prospective Client 
                          is situated, e.g. where the Client is living/incorporated or where the place of the main business 
                          activity of the Client is situated or where the main part of the customers of the Client comes 
                          from; it is important to establish if such main place of interests of the Client is situated in the 
                          country other than FATF country or in the Target territory; in such event the Client has to be 
                          considered as a high risk client.</p>

                          <li>a prospective Client is not able to answer the questions provided by the Employee 
                            or by non-face- to-face identification measures and related to the financial activity 
                            of the potential Client, the nature and the aims of such activity;</li>
                          <li>a prospective Client is unusually stressed and nervous during the verbal 
                            communication with the Employee, especially when asked the questions related to 
                            the financial activity of a prospectiveClient.</li>
                        </ul>

                          Client or, if decided to further continue with the due diligence procedure, the enhanced due

                        <p><b>8. </b> After the risk assessment is performed, the Client is assigned to one of three

                        <ul>

                            and ML/TF prevention measures apply;</li>
                          <li>Low Risk Clients who are defined in Section 10 below - the simplified due diligence 
                            and ML/TF prevention measures may apply.</li>
                          <li>The profile of the Client is reviewed periodically (at least once a year) reflecting 
                            the changes in the Business relationship and behavior of the Client as well as based 
                            on the results of the ongoing monitoring of the Client. Thus, the risk profile and, so, 
                            the ML/TF prevention measures applied with respect of the Client may change from 
                            time to time.</li>

                          ML/TF prevention activities and is the focal point for all such activity of the Company, 
                          including the Client Due Diligence and furtherongoing monitoring of the Clients as well as the 
                          suspension and reporting to the FIU of the Suspicious Monetary operations and Transactions 
                          and all communication with the FIU. If during the Due Diligence stage or later during the 
                          ongoing monitoring of the Client the Employee has any doubts about the Client or its financial 
                          activity, the Employee must apply to the Officer. The Officer has to undertake the needed 
                          internal investigation actions and decide if the circumstances reported by the Employee raise 
                          high risk of ML/TF. The Officer decides if the Client who raised the doubts can be accepted, 
                          which risk category such Client has to be assigned and if the enhanced due diligence and 
                          ongoing monitoring have to be undertaken with respect of such Client. All decisions of the 
                          Officer as well as reasons for such decisions should always be documented and kept by the 
                          Officer on file.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>6. </b> Employees should always file a report to the Officer upon knowledge or 
                          suspicion of ML/FT, and it is the Officer who would then consider if a Monetary operation or 
                          Transaction has to be suspended and reported to the FIU. If the Officer decides that the 
                          Monetary operation or Transaction reported to Officer by theEmployee is not a Suspicious 
                          Monetary operation or Transaction and there is no need to suspend it and report to the FIU, the 
                          reasons of such a decision should always be documented and kept by the Officer on file. Once 
                          an internal report on the Suspicious Monetary operation or Transaction is lodged with the 
                          Officer, the latter should then consider the report in the light of all other relevant information 
                          in the Company'spossession. The Officer is to determine whether the transaction gives rise to 
                          knowledge or suspicion that a Client is or could be engaged in ML or TF. The Officer is not 
                          expected to investigate the transaction other than internally or to decide whether the funds are 
                          the proceeds of criminal activity. If the Officer is in doubt as to the possibility of ML/TF 
                          involvement, he may seek guidance from the FIU. If the report on the suspicious Monetary 
                          operation or Transaction is not filed with the FIU, the Officer should document the reasons for 
                          such decision.</p>
