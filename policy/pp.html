                        <p><b>6. PRINCIPLES FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA</b></p>
                        <p>While Processing Personal data, the Company will respect the following general principles:</p>
                        <p>a. <span style="font-weight: 700;">Fairness and lawfulness</span>
                          – When we process Personal data, the individuals’ rights of the Data subjects must be protected. 
                          Personal Data must be collected and processed lawfully, in a fair manner, in good faith and must be proportionate to the objective.</p>
                        <p>b. <span style="font-weight: 700;">Restricted to a specific purpose</span>
                          – Personal data handled by the Company should be adequate and relevant to the purpose for which they are collected and processed. 
                          This requires, in particular, ensuring that the types of Personal data collected are not excessive for the purpose for which they are collected. 
                          Subsequent changes to the purpose are only possible to a limited extent and require substantiation.</p>
                        <p>c. <span style="font-weight: 700;">Transparency</span>
                          – The Data subject must be informed of how his/her Personal data is being handled. 
                          When the Personal data is collected, the Data subject must be informed of: the existence of the present Policy; 
                          the identity of the Data controller; the purpose of Personal data Processing; third parties to whom the data might be transmitted.</p>
                        <p>d. <span style="font-weight: 700;">Consent of the Data subject</span>
                          – Personal data must be collected directly from the individual concerned and the Consent of the Data subject may be required before Processing Personal data. 
                          The Consent must be obtained in writing or electronically for the purposes of documentation. The Consent is valid only if given voluntarily. 
                          If, for any reason, the Consent of the Data subject is not given before Processing Personal data, 
                          this one should be secured in writing as soon as possible after the beginning of the Processing. 
                          Personal data can be processed without Consent if it is necessary to enforce a legitimate interest of the Company. 
                          Legitimate interests are generally of a legal (e.g. filing, enforcing or defending against legal claims) or 
                          financial (e.g. valuation of companies) nature. The Processing of Personal data is also permitted if national legislation requests, requires or allows this.</p>
                        <p>e. <span style="font-weight: 700;">Accuracy</span>
                          – Personal data kept on file must be correct and if necessary, kept up to date. Inaccurate or incomplete Personal data should not be kept on file and deleted.</p>
