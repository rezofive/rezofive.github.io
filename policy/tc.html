                          The Client acknowledges and accepts that the receipt and granting of Benefits may lead to potential conflicts of interests. 
                          Rezo Five takes all appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate disadvantages to the Client resulting from any potential conflict of interest.</p>

                          <p><b>8. RIGHT OF LIEN AND SET-OFF </b></p>

                            irrespective of the due dates of such claims or fiat currencies or Digital Assets in which they are denominated. If amounts subject to set-off are denominated in other than in Euro or 
                            the Client’s reference fiat currency, Rezo Five will convert such amounts in its discretion using a conversion rate selected. 
                            Rezo Five has the right to convert any claims the Client may have against 
                            Rezo Five to a claim nominated in fiat currencies in order to set-off any claims Rezo Five has against the Client arising from the Business Relationship. 
                            The Right of lien and set-off shall also apply to claims resulting from any unsecured or collateralized loan or credit facilities.</p>

                              Rezo Five has provided in communication to the Client for this purpose. 
                              If the Client transfers Digital Assets to a blockchain addresses not provided in communication by Rezo Five, there is a risk that the Digital Assets cannot be allocated to the Client.

                            <p>The Client is obliged to monitor the market on its own to stay informed about, inter alia, airdrops and forks (collectively, the “Digital Asset Actions”). 
                              Rezo Five has no duty to inform the Client of any Digital Asset Actions. 
                              Rezo Five has the right but not the duty to take actions on behalf of the Client such as voting or claiming Digital Assets originating from airdrops or forks. 
                              The Client gives consent to Rezo Five to use the Client’s Digital Assets to conduct Digital Asset Actions. 
                              It is at the sole discretion of Rezo Five to not support Digital Assets originating from forks or airdrops and associated blockchains for any reasons such as technical or commercial. 
                              If Rezo Five decides to support, Rezo Five gives no guarantee that such support actually takes place. 
                              If Rezo Five decides to (1) not take any Digital Asset actions or (2) not support Digital Assets originating from forks or airdrops, 
                              the Client has no right to claim damages or compensation of any kind from Rezo Five. 
                              If the Client wishes to participate in Digital Asset Actions, 
                              the Client is encouraged to consult Third-Party providers for this purpose and to transfer the corresponding Digital Assets, if applicable. 
                              However, in such instances Rezo Five does not guarantee timely execution of transactions, 
                              therefore it is the Client’s responsibility to obtain information and initiate respective arrangements well in advance. 
                              At its sole discretion, Rezo Five has the right to convert Digital Assets originating from airdrops or forks into fiat currencies or Digital Assets. 
                              If Rezo Five decides to pay out in fiat currencies, the Client does not have the right to acquire ownership of the Digital Assets resulting from a Digital Asset Actions. 
                              Rezo Five may decide at its sole discretion to suspend/temporarily shut down any exchange, 
                              trading or any transaction with respect to Digital Assets which are part of/influenced by Digital Asset Actions, 
                              in particular if it considers such measure to be required or beneficial for the protection of the Client.

                              applied thresholds are processed at the sole discretion of Rezo Five and depend on the underlying blockchain mechanism and rules of distribution. </p>
